# Problem
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Key
That's easy. Yep, I know. But the matter is we'll do it by mathematics.

Let's go
### We need to find all of number that are multiples of 3 or 5 and less than 1000.
  - The numbers that are multiples of 3 less than 1000 is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,..., 999. And sum of them is: S3 = 3 + 6 + 9 +...+ 999
  - The numbers that are multiples of 5 less than 1000 is 5, 10, 15, 20, ....995. And sum of them is: S5 = 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 +...+ 995
  - As you see, we counted 15, 30, 45,.., 990  two times because they're muliples of 3 and 5. So, sum of them is: S15 = 15 + 30 + 45 + ...+ 990
  - Sum = S3 + S5 - S15
